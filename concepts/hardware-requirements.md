# Hardware requirements
A lot of different devices are supported on Ombori grid, however we do need to specify minimum requirements. Following these requirements you should be able to run the Marketplace Apps on these devices. If you have any questions if certain hardware is supported in your specific case please contact us on Slack.

Keep in mind all these specifications are minimum specifications, anything above would work well.

## Intel
Intel Devices are supported by default. We recommend installing GridOS on these devices. Our go-to recommendation is NUC devices as they're compact, however any intel device will work out-of-the-box. When [adding the device](/concepts/adding-device/) just make sure to follow the Intel (NUC) installation guide.

**Minimum requirements**

- Intel Celeron Quad Core 1.5GHz
- 10GB hdd
- 4GB ram

## Raspberry Pi
For Raspberry Pi we recommend getting Raspberry Pi 4 or better. 

**Minimum requirements**
- Raspberry Pi 4
- SD Card A2. Read Speed > 150MB/s. Write Speed > 60MB/s
- Heatsink Case with fan
- 4GB model

Without heatsink case and fan the Raspberry pi might overheat, especially when playing videos. You *could* get away with just a heatsink and no fan if your content is light. If you have questions about this contact us on Slack.
