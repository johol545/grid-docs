# Grid Product Information Management
Grid Product Information Management (Grid-PIM) is the service of Ombori that centralizes product data of clients that can be used within OmboriGrid and developed apps, for example in (Mobile) Endless Aisle or a custom integration.

To understand how to integrate Grid-PIM there are several documents that can help you. But when you start fresh, it is recommended to check the [Integration Flow](/grid-pim/integration-flow) first.

- [API Reference](/grid-pim/api)
- [Data Models](/grid-pim/data-model)

Each of these can also be found in the sidebar, as well as other complementary documents.
