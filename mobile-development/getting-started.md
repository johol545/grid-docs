# Building a Mobile PWA
A Mobile PWA (Progressive Web App) is an application that can run on mobile devices and be connected to any device on the same network as a remote.

We begin with creating a mobile project from a template using the CLI

```bash
omg app create <project-name>
```
> Replace `<project-name>` with the name of your choosing. We recommend sticking with kebab-case formatting.

Once the project is done creating, step into the project, and run `yarn start` to launch the application locally. This will allow you to test if the project was created successfully. You should see `Connecting...` on screen.
