# Media Library
Within the console, you have access to a media library. All the files stored inside the media library are accessible to use in the configuration in every installed application on the Ombori Grid.

To use the media library, log in to the console and navigate to the media library. You can find the media library in the "Library" tab in the sidebar, and then you can click on "Media".

## Uploading files
You can upload new files to the media library by clicking the "Click or drag file to this area to upload" button on top of the screen, or as the text says, drag files directly to the area.

## Optimization
Video files uploaded to the media library are optimized for space and resolution; however, it is essential to upload optimized files for both images and videos before you upload them to ensure the best performance of your installations.
