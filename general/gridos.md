# GridOS
GridOS is the operating system in use in the Ombori Grid. Any ARM and Intel-based computer can host the GridOS operating system as long as it conforms to the hardware requirements presented in the [Hardware Requirements](/development/general/hardware-requirements) page. But not just Intel devices are supported by GridOS. Raspberry Pi 4 is also supported with the optimized version of GridOS.

## Linux Based
GridOS is a custom build on top of Ubuntu 21.10. This makes sure we support any hardware configuration supported by Ubuntu.

## Easy installation
One of the major benefits of GridOS is the fact it's optimized to work with the Ombori Grid platform. Provisioning a device is as easy as scanning a QR code presented on the newly set-up device and logging in to the console. 

From there, you will easily be able to install any application that's available in the console.

## Over-the-air updates
GridOS is updated over-the-air. This means that you can update your GridOS installation to the latest version without having to reinstall it, or access it physically.

But not only is GridOS updated over-the-air, so is any application you've deployed to your device. This means you will never have to worry you need to physically access your device(s).
