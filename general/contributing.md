# Contributing to Documentation
The Ombori Grid Documentation is a growing and evolving project, and far from everything has been added to the documentation.

In the end, the goal is to make the documentation the single source of truth for the Ombori Grid.

When you want to add new content to the documentation, check carefully where it fits in the documentation structure, and make sure to check the relevant section of this guide.

## New Guides
When adding a new guide, make sure to add them to the section it's relevant to. For example, when it is relevant to any published marketplace apps, add it to the section "Marketplace Apps". Queue Management is a good example, as there are already several guides nested under it. As for other marketplace apps we don't even have a setup guide yet.

If the guides are relevant to app development, add them to the relevant app type, so for IoT apps, add them to the section "IoT Apps". When they're a subsection of different guides, make sure to link them from the guide it relates to. Not all guides need to be added to the sidebar, only those that are great standalone.

When a section in the sidebar is growing to get more guides, at some point we will need to migrate to a standalone sidebar for said section. This is something that cannot be defined when this is important, but it is something we will need to discuss when the time comes.

For any guide that is going to be added, follow the following guidelines:

- The guide should be added to the right folder structure.
- Consider when the guide should be added to the sidebar.
- Add screenshots and code samples to every step that can use clarification.
- Link the guide in other documents where it can be helpful.

When you're done with a new guide, submit a PR, and if you're in contact with one of the core maintainers, ask them to review the PR. This can also be submitted on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/slack-pgo5586/shared_invite/zt-s1ajca83-k8i1f2mqgCMD0vDfpCk4Bg).
