# Basic Onboarding Guide
This page is a basic guide on how to onboard your teammates and colleagues to the OmboriGrid Platform.

## Onboarding Developers
1. Login to [OmboriGrid Console](https://console.omborigrid.com)
2. Create an account for the new user. Go to `Admin > Users`

3. After adding the account, the user should have access to the OmboriGrid Console. We suggest to assign `Admin` role to developers.
4. The new account for the developer should be ready to use. 
5. The developer can install the [omg CLI (OmboriGrid Command Line Interface)](https://developer.omborigrid.com/#/cli/setup?id=installing-the-ombori-cli). Login using the [developer's token](https://developer.omborigrid.com/#/cli/setup?id=authentication) that you can create from the OmboriGrid Console.
6. The developer can start [building applications](http://localhost:3000/#/app-development/building-your-first-screen-app).
