# Queue Manager Release 2021-08-31
On August 31th 2021 we released a new minor version of the Queue Manager, this is visible in the settings screen.

## Changes
- Staff notifications - now we can send emails to staff when the email feature is enabled if conditions are met. For example when the waiting time is too long.
