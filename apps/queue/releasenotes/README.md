On September 9th 2021 we released a new minor version of the Queue Manager.

### Changes
- Categories: You can now set up custom labels for different categories in the Console. This will reflect in the customer registration flow (customer will have to specify category) and it will be shown in queue manager UI.

**How do you use it?** First, specify the categories, then add the type *Categories* in the registration flow section. You can see how it looks in the screenshots below.
