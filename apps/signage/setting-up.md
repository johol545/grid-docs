## Configuration

Now you've completed installation, it's time to configure it. First find your installation in the sidebar where you've installed it. 

Once you've opened it you can configure your signage. You can do this by [adding content](/apps/signage/adding-content.md), or you can start by [adding a device](/concepts/adding-device.md).
