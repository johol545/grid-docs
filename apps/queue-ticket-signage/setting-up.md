## Configuration

Now you've completed the installation, it's time to configure it. First, find your installation in the sidebar where you've installed it.

Once you've opened it you can configure your queue ticket signage. You can do this by [adding content](/apps/queue-ticket-signage/adding-content.md), or you can start by [adding a device](/general/adding-device.md).
