# Build your first Mobile App

To get going to build a mobile app within Ombori Grid you only have to follow the basic instructions like any other app on the Ombori Grid ecosystem. You run a CLI command to generate the project, and from there you can publish this.

```bash
omg app create [app-name]
```
Where you replace `[app-name]` with the name you want your app to have.

> A mobile app within Ombori Grid is a Progressive Web App (PWA), not a native app running on the phone itself.
