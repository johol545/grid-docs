# Ombori Documentation

Welcome to the Ombori Documentation, all you need to know about working with the Ombori Grid and related tooling can be found about in here. 

!> This documentation is still a work in progress and will not contain all information. If you need specific documentation please contact us directly.

## The Ombori Grid
The Ombori Grid allows any developer to integrate hardware, manage deployments and build amazing infrastructure in physical spaces. You can build a screen that responds on sensors, control hardware based on user interaction, respond to users requests and much much more. 


> Got a great use case for us to demo right here? Submit it to us on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/slack-pgo5586/shared_invite/zt-s1ajca83-k8i1f2mqgCMD0vDfpCk4Bg)!
