# Ombori Grid
You've found it, the Ombori Grid Documentation. On here you'll find all you need to know about  how to work with the Ombori Grid, but also how the Ombori Grid operates, what intentions it has and what it can do.

## Apps
The Ombori Grid is built up on top of applications. These applications can be applied to any device in a variety of ways. There are mobile applications (PWA), Screen Applications, and IoT applications.  Most solutions build on top of the Ombori Grid consist of a combination of applications. 

For example, an Ombori-build solution is the Queueing solution. The queueing solution consists of a server-side application running the database, a mobile application for customers to create tickets, a screen application to display what ticket is next, and another screen application for staff to call for next tickets. Then there is a kiosk at which customers can also print a ticket, which consists of a screen application for the interface, and a dockerized IoT application that runs the printer from local hardware, like a Raspberry Pi 4 or an Intel NUC.
